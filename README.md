# Company-homepage-with-flexbox

Excluding a very basic homepage in HTML and CSS, this is my very first project, and very first repository posted on GitHub.
Additionally, I just realized, this is of course also my very first READ-ME file...COOL...:-D
I uploaded this project via the built-in features in VS Code.

This is a project based very much in reality, everything written on the page is true except for the first line as I have never opened a bakery,
although it is somethig I am still considering to do. I'd like to open a small wagon type service, and maybe only be open during some holidays,
festivals, and some weekends during the summertime. Coding is my first passion, but I would like to supplement it with other projects/passions to
avoid burnout.

I created this webpage and focused a good deal on using Flexbox for the very first time. I learned flexbox via Codecademy as well as a fantastic
little game called Felxbox Zombies (I highly recommend).

If anyone ever reads this I just want to say I am flattered, and I hope to impress you down the road with how far my programming skills will take me.
Kind regards,
Robert Pinney
